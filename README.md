# Alcohol-Crime_ML_Analytics
This project is a Python pipeline that examines the relationship between per-capita alcohol consumption and homicide rates across European countries. It loads and cleans Excel and CSV data, generates descriptive stats and visualizations, fits linear, non-linear, spline and ML models, and compares their performance.
